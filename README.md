# chestUI-with-custombuttons
Add custom buttons to chestUI
this works Minecraft Bedrock Edition

## How to do it

1.
Set "is_showing_menu" to false for the chest UI so that it can coexist with other UIs.
Set "always_accepts_input" to true so that it always accepts operations.

2.
Set "force_render_below" to true and place it on top of other UIs.
â†’The UIs will coexist.

3.
Adjust the button position nicely.

4.
Even if you press the close button, only the form will close, so add a button to close the form.
When you press that button, it will tp 1000 blocks directly above and force the UI to close.
To make it compatible with the esc key, do the same thing when cancellationReason is UserClosed.

5.
The animation when the form closes can be set to "$screen_animations": []
"$background_animations": [].

## Problems
* The name of the chest cannot be obtained with ScriptAPI, so the condition for activating the form cannot be based on the name. The coordinate reference is fine.
* I don't know how to change whether or not a form is animated depending on the name.
* I don't know how to arrange buttons from right to left.
* In this sample add-on, forms are opened without distinguishing by name.
* I want to be able to specify the button texture from the ScriptAPI.
